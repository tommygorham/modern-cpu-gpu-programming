SERIAL PROGRAMS 

### The program below is a serial matrix-vector dot product
    Performance is measured with the chrono library ###
    serial.cpp: g++ -Wall -std=c++20 -o runserial serial.cpp


### The program below is a serial matrix-vector dot product, identical to serial.cpp.
    However, this time we measure performance with openmp ###

    serial2.cpp: g++ -Wall -std=c++20 -o runserial2 serial2.cpp -fopenmp
